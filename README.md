# SUMO
Contains current WIP training files and the pipeline. 

# To Run
Run the pipeline by running the SUMOSummaryPipeline.py file. 
enter 1 and then type in the available case numbers. 
enter 2 with the link of the case on BAILII website.

To support the linking of judgments, a parser and ASMO labeller is necessary. 

# Data
how data is stored when the summary is created: 
    first level - /data/UKHLcorpus (cases)
                    /summarydata/UKHL_ - this is the relevant case name, 
                    updated with _feaetures at the end once the feature set is created

 to run with testing case numbers - need the UKHL corpus individual cases in a file called UKHL_corpus
 also need to duplicate and label it UKHL_corpus2 as it needs to be open twice at once - NEED TO FIX THIS
 
 nb - also need the 68txt_corpus and SUM_69_corpus folders in the /data folder as well as the corpus_list.csv 
 wordlist.csv and UKHL_corpus.csv - these files just stay in the /data file root
 
 also create a /summarydata folder, the files inside are generated by the code. 
 

# To Do
- [x] Switch cue phrases feature-set in the feature extractor 
- [X] Add cue phrases feature-set in the ml pipeline - relevance 
- [X] Add new classifier - relevance
- [X] Add cue phrases feature-set in the ml pipeline - rhetorical
- [x] Train the DTC classifier for the relevance feature set
- [X] Remove the relevance CRF code
- [X] Integrate the DTC classifier into the pipeline
- [X] Integrate ASMO into the pipeline
- [X] Re-train CRF classifier using best performing normal ML classifier for rhet labels
- [X] Updated pipepline to use re-trained CRF classifier
